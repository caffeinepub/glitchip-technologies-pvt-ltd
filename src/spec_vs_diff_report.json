  "summary": "Backend changes introduce a Motoko migration that filters out job postings titled “Frontend Developer”, “Backend Developer”, and “Mobile App Developer” during canister upgrade, and wires this migration into backend/main.mo. However, the diff summary shows no changes to the Careers page frontend rendering, so the frontend requirement to hide those job cards on /careers is not evidenced as implemented. Additionally, project_state.json was modified without being requested in the BuildRequest.",

      "reason": "The diff summary contains only backend Motoko changes and a project_state.json update; no frontend Careers page/Open Positions/job-card rendering changes are shown, so there is no evidence the UI stops rendering those cards.",
