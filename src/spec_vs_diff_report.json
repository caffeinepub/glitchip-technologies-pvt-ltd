  "summary": "Diff adds a multi-page React marketing site with TanStack Router routes for Home/Services/Why Us/Products/Careers/Contact, a global header/footer with logo and CTA, theme styling, and basic page/section animations with reduced-motion support. It also adds a Motoko backend with seeded jobs and endpoints for listing jobs and submitting job applications/contact forms, but several requirements are not evidenced (notably custom-domain well-known + DNS docs, favicon/app icon, and explicit stable/persistent storage across upgrades and admin listing APIs).",

      "requirement": "Provide a favicon/app icon based on the provided logo (IMG-20250404-WA0002.png).",

      "reason": "backend/main.mo shows in-memory Maps for jobs and jobApplications but the diff does not evidence stable variables or preupgrade/postupgrade hooks. Also, no method to list applications is visible in the provided backend snippet.",

      "reason": "frontend calls actor.getCompanyContacts() and submitContactForm(), but the backend snippet is truncated before showing contact submission storage/list APIs. Persistence across upgrades is also not evidenced (no stable vars/hooks shown).",
